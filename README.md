# Full-Stack Web Application CI/CD Pipeline with ArgoCD, Jenkins, and Kubernetes

This repository demonstrates the use of **ArgoCD**, **Jenkins**, and **Kubernetes** to deploy a **full-stack web application** in a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Background

This project automates the process of deploying a full-stack web application, which consists of a frontend, backend, and database. The CI/CD pipeline ensures that every code change is automatically built, tested, and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. The use of **Jenkins**, **ArgoCD**, and **Kubernetes** streamlines the deployment process, ensuring that the application is always up to date and running smoothly.

## Technologies

### Jenkins
- **Role**: Jenkins automates the build and testing processes for the application.
- **Functionality**: It detects changes in the code repository, triggers builds, runs tests, and creates Docker images, which are then pushed to a container registry.

### ArgoCD
- **Role**: ArgoCD automates the deployment process of the application to Kubernetes.
- **Functionality**: It watches for changes in a Git repository (which contains Kubernetes deployment configurations) and synchronizes these changes to the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring the latest application version is always deployed.

### Kubernetes
- **Role**: Kubernetes is the container orchestration platform used to deploy and manage the application.
- **Functionality**: Kubernetes takes care of deploying, scaling, and managing containers. It ensures that the full-stack web application runs reliably, with self-healing and automatic scaling features.

## How It Works

1. **Code Changes**: Developers push code changes to the Git repository.
2. **Build and Test**: **Jenkins** automatically triggers the build process, running tests and creating Docker images of the application.
3. **Push Docker Image**: Jenkins pushes the new Docker images to a container registry (like DockerHub or AWS ECR).
4. **Deployment**: **ArgoCD** detects the changes in the Git repository, updates the Kubernetes configurations, and automatically deploys the latest version of the application to the **Kubernetes** cluster.
5. **Kubernetes**: The application is deployed and managed on Kubernetes, ensuring that it is always running, scaled properly, and healthy.

These tools work together to create a fully automated pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the full-stack web application with minimal manual intervention.

## Benefits

- **Automated Pipeline**: Each code change automatically triggers the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Efficient Management**: Kubernetes takes care of scaling and managing the application, ensuring high availability and performance.
- **Continuous Delivery**: ArgoCD ensures that the latest code changes are automatically reflected in the Kubernetes cluster.

This CI/CD setup enhances the speed and reliability of software delivery, making it easier to deploy and maintain modern web applications.
